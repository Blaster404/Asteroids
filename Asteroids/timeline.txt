customizable ships
default spaceship - just a normal cool looking thingy
firebolt - makes a cool short range flame (destroys everything in your path, but lower health)
thunderbolt - snipes a very fast 5000 fps lazer bolt through the space, almost the speed of light, very powerful bullet that can
pierce through enemies, but it is a slower spaceship but has slightly higher health than the default
