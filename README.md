that a group of asteroids suddenly appeared and some of them might potentially harm earth. Help was needed quickly. The asteroids need to
be destroyed before reaching earth. Can you do it?

Space to shoot.

# Description
I created this game back in 2020. It was for a game competition and i managed to win an award. The codeblocks looks very messy and disorganized but this is me in 2020, and i tried my best organising it, didn't go well.
<br/>
Anyways i decided to make this open source if anyone wants the code. 
<br/>
I could've made this game better by if the asteroid manages to get to the other side, earth hp will be affected. I should've created that but oh well, whatever. Anyways hope you like it.
